## 📝 Usage Instructions

### For Human Users:
1. **Mark status** by replacing `☐` with `☑️` for applicable checkboxes
2. **Assign tasks** by filling in `@username` in the Assigned column
3. **Track progress** by updating checkboxes as work progresses
4. **Multiple statuses** can be active (e.g., Assigned + Being Worked)

### For AI Agents/Co-pilot:
```markdown
To update an item:
- Replace ☐ with ☑️ to mark as checked
- Replace ☑️ with ☐ to uncheck
- Fill @_________ with actual username for assignments

Example:
Before: | ☐ | ☐ @_________ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
After:  | ☐ | ☑️ @agent-alpha | ☑️ | ☐ | ☐ |
```

### Status Workflow:
1. **New** → Item identified, not yet assigned
2. **Assigned** → Someone is responsible (add @username)
3. **Being Worked** → Active development in progress
4. **Stuck** → Blocked or needs assistance
5. **Complete** → Finished and verified
