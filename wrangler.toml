# Cloudflare Pages configuration
# This project uses Cloudflare Pages for static frontend deployment
# The backend (Express.js) requires a Node.js runtime and should be
# deployed separately on a compatible platform (e.g., Railway, Render, etc.)
#
# For Pages deployment, configure in Cloudflare Dashboard:
# - Build command: npm run build
# - Build output directory: dist/public
# - Node.js version: 22 (set NODE_VERSION=22 in environment variables)
#
# See CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed instructions.

name = "project-swarm"
compatibility_date = "2024-11-24"

# Note: Cloudflare Pages is configured via the dashboard or wrangler pages commands.
# This file is provided for reference and local development with wrangler.
# The Express.js backend is NOT compatible with Cloudflare Workers runtime
# due to Node.js-specific APIs (http.createServer, express, ws, etc.).

# Environment variables (set in Cloudflare Pages dashboard)
# NODE_VERSION = "22"
