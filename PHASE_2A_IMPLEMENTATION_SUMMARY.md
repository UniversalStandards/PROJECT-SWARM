## What Was Built

### ðŸŽ¯ Backend Infrastructure

#### 1. Database Schema Enhancements
- **Added `stepIndex` field** to `execution_logs` table for step tracking
- **Added indexes** on `executionId` and `timestamp` for performance
- Enhanced log storage with metadata support

#### 2. Enhanced Storage Layer (`server/storage.ts`)
```typescript
getLogsByExecutionId(executionId: string, filters?: {
  level?: string;
  agentId?: string;
  limit?: number;
  offset?: number;
}): Promise<ExecutionLog[]>
```
- Added filtering capabilities for logs
- Support for pagination with limit/offset
- Filter by log level and agent ID

#### 3. New API Endpoints (`server/routes.ts`)

**Enhanced Logs Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/executions/:id/logs?level=error&agentId=xxx&limit=100&offset=0
```
- Query params for filtering by level, agentId
- Pagination support
- Returns filtered execution logs

**Timeline Endpoint:**
```
GET /api/executions/:id/timeline
```
- Returns step-by-step execution data
- Includes agent names, durations, status
- Groups logs by step index

**Comparison Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/executions/compare
Body: { executionIds: ["id1", "id2", ...] }
```
- Compare 2+ executions side-by-side
- Returns metrics: duration, errors, warnings, token counts
- Includes input/output comparison data

#### 4. Orchestrator Enhancements (`server/ai/orchestrator.ts`)
- **Step tracking:** Each agent execution gets a stepIndex
- **Timing data:** Records start/end time for each step
- **Duration tracking:** Calculates and logs step durations
- **Enhanced error handling:** Step-level error context
- **Metadata support:** Logs can include additional context

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

**Polling vs WebSocket:**
- âœ… Chose polling for simplicity
- âœ… Sufficient for current scale
- âœ… 2-second interval provides good UX
- âš¡ Can upgrade to WebSocket later if needed

**Component Structure:**
- All components in `client/src/components/execution/`
- Reusable, composable architecture
- Consistent with existing Shadcn UI patterns
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

**Performance Considerations:**
- Efficient filtering on backend
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Memoized computations in components
- Conditional polling based on execution status

### Data Flow

```
1. User navigates to execution detail page
   â†“
2. Frontend fetches execution, logs, messages, timeline
   â†“
3. Components render with initial data
   â†“
4. If execution is running:
   - Poll logs endpoint every 2s
   - Poll messages endpoint every 2s
   - Poll timeline endpoint every 2s
   - Auto-scroll to bottom
   â†“
5. When execution completes:
   - Stop polling
   - Show final state
```

- New executions will populate stepIndex
- Indexes improve query performance

### API
- All new endpoints are additive (no breaking changes)
- Existing endpoints remain unchanged
- Query parameters are optional (backward compatible)

### Frontend
- New routes don't conflict with existing routes
- Existing execution monitor still works
- New pages are opt-in via navigation links

---

## Performance Metrics

### Bundle Size Impact
- **Before:** ~650 kB
- **After:** 693.65 kB
- **Increase:** ~43 kB (6.7% increase)
- **Assessment:** Acceptable for added functionality

### API Response Times (Expected)
- Logs endpoint: <100ms for 1000 logs
- Timeline endpoint: <200ms (aggregation required)
- Comparison endpoint: <300ms for 2 executions

- âœ… Consistent naming conventions
- âœ… Proper error handling
- âœ… Component composition principles
- âœ… DRY principles followed

### Documentation
